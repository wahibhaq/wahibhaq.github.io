# On Going Projects

* **wahibhaq.github.io**



# Completed

* ##### Android Video Gallery  
    This is a demo application which was developed as a submission to coding challenge given by Dubsmash as first phase of hiring process.  Source is available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-videogallery).   

* ##### Connect-Github  
    Around Jan-Feb 2015, I started working on a side project with [Mustafa Abdelhai](https://abdelhai.com) which was meant to ***exclusively help Programmers in bringing their Portfolios alive***. It was Mustafa's idea that there is absolutely nothing like ***_Dribbble for Programmers_*** and I agreed. While working on the prototype version, I wanted to fetch user's Github data using Python but didn't find any solid tutorial or learning resource. 
    >Once completed, I decided to publish a very basic python implementation to show how to connect and fetch data from [Github Official API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) using [PyGithub](http://jacquev6.net/PyGithub/v1/introduction.html). 

    The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/connect-github). I couldn't continue with him due to time constraints but I am so happy that he continued and the idea is live today in shape of [***Devolio***](https://devolio.net). ==I would advise you to check it out, use it and give your feedback !!==  

* ##### Masters Thesis : Speaker Detection and Conversation Analysis on Mobile Devices
    I submitted thesis in May 2015 and It was associated with [Cooperative Systems Chair](http://wwwschlichter.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/chair?newlang=en) of [TUM Informatics](http://www.in.tum.de/en.html) Faculty. The scope of project was to implement, investigate and compare offline approaches for audio processing on Android device. It involved Smart Probing strategies, Recording, Voice Activity Detection, Feature Extraction and using machine learning techniques for Speaker Recognition. The challenge was to perform everything on Android device without Internet and then investiagate energy consumption (battery usage, memory usage and cpu usage). Then comparison needs to be made with extracted features when sent to Server which was already functional. 
    >This thesis topic presents design, implementation and evaluation of real-time voice activity detection system on the conversation, recorded by a smartphone to potentially identify its owner. The findings and deliverable would become a basis for future work in smart mobile interruption management.

    Project details and Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-speaker-audioanalysis). The submitted Thesis report is also accessible on [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/12802417/Speaker_Detection_and_Conversation_Analysis_on_Mobile_Devices).
    
* ##### Lane Detection using OpenCV & Android

    This project was developed as a semester project during my masters program. The Android app detects lanes on road, overlays using a red line and calculate estimated values of Standard Deviation of Lane Position (SDLP) based on position of car in the lain. The motivation of developing this android app as a proof of concept was to help researchers in domain of ergonomics to investigate driverâ€™s behavior in different scenarios.   
    Source and details are available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-opencv-lanedetection).
