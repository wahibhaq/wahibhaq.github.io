### [Urdu Font Comparator App](http://wahibhaq.com/projects/urdu-font-comparator-app/)

This project is about an Android application (soon available on Google Play) which allows users to explore various Urdu Fonts, eventually helping them in choosing the right one. This project is additionally intended to make users appreciate why Nasta'liq script should be a natural choice for Urdu content on mobile devices. 

It is a very personal project which I formally kicked off in Feb 2017. I was also super motivated because one of my 2017 New Year's goals was to develop my own Android app from scratch and get it published on Google Play. This idea seemed like a good way to achieve this goal. The The source code is also available as open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/wahibhaq/urdu-font-comparator-app).

### [Ultimate Resources for Android Developers](https://github.com/wahibhaq/ultimate-resources-android-devs)

Like any other developer, I explore, read and follow a lot of different resources related to Android and regularly bookmark something I feel like important and useful for future. I decided to publish my bookmarks and my research as my first blog post titled [**Ultimate Resources for Android Devs**](http://wahibhaq.com/blog/ultimate-resources-android-dev/). Then, I realized that it makes more sense to create a [repo](https://github.com/wahibhaq/ultimate-resources-android-devs) and keep updating it with the passage of time and ask other devs as well to contribute and help in increasing it's knowledgebase.

### [Slack Community for Android Devs from Pakistan](androiddevs-pakistan.slack.com)

I have created a [Slack community for Android Developers](androiddevs-pakistan.slack.com) exclusively for Pakistanis. Long story short, it's purpose is to provide a platform to devs in Pakistan to connect and discuss problems together. At the same time, it is also intended to help in knowledge transfer from experts working in International companies and researchers in foreign universities. After talking to fellow devs and graduating students, many of us have realized that there's a significant gap when it comes to care for "doing things the right way" and using latest tools and libraries. Experts working anywhere in the world can get a chance to help and groom those who are really interested to up their game.

We have currently 50+ members and it's growing every week. If you are interested, you are more than welcome to join or otherwise at least do share this [invite page link](https://slack-androidpak-landingpage.herokuapp.com/) with the right people.

### Personal Website + Blog + Portfolio : [wahibhaq.com](http://wahibhaq.com)  

I have been planning to have my personal website for a long time and finally, it is getting executed. It is hosted using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I was looking for something which saves me effort of hosting and still get that feeling of 'geekiness' of customizing things by hand. After extensive research to chose the appropriate theme, I ended up using [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme which is clean, elegant and serves the purpose. The website is hosted on _Github_ as a public repository (obviously!) and made my domain i.e [**wahibhaq.com**](http://wahibhaq.com) point to the _Github Pages_ site.

### Android Video Gallery  
    
This is a demo application which was developed as a submission to coding challenge given by Dubsmash as first phase of hiring process.  Source is available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-videogallery).

### Connect-Github  

Around Jan-Feb 2015, I started working on a side project with [Mustafa Abdelhai](https://abdelhai.com) which was meant to ***exclusively help Programmers in bringing their Portfolios alive***. It was Mustafa's idea that there is absolutely nothing like ***Dribbble for Programmers*** and I agreed. While working on the prototype version, I wanted to fetch user's Github data using Python but didn't find any solid tutorial or learning resource.  
   
> Once completed, I decided to publish a very basic python implementation to show how to connect and fetch data from [Github Official API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) using [PyGithub](http://jacquev6.net/PyGithub/v1/introduction.html). 

The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/connect-github). I couldn't continue with him due to time constraints but I am so happy that he continued and the idea is live today in shape of [**Devolio**](https://devolio.net).

Also, I would highly recommend to check out Devolio, use it and give your feedback !!

### Masters Thesis : Speaker Detection and Conversation Analysis on Mobile Devices

I submitted thesis in May 2015 and It was done in association with [Cooperative Systems Chair](http://wwwschlichter.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/chair?newlang=en) of [TUM Informatics](http://www.in.tum.de/en.html) Faculty. The scope of project was to implement, investigate and compare offline vs online approaches for audio processing on Android device. It involved Smart Probing strategies, Recording, Feature Extraction and investigating Energy consumption (battery usage, memory usage and cpu usage) for Voice Activity Detection.   

> This thesis topic presents design, implementation and evaluation of real-time voice activity detection system on the conversation, recorded by a smartphone to potentially identify its owner. The findings and deliverable would become a basis for future work in smart mobile interruption management.

Project details and Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-speaker-audioanalysis). The submitted Thesis report is also accessible on [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/12802417/Speaker_Detection_and_Conversation_Analysis_on_Mobile_Devices).

### Lane Detection using OpenCV & Android

This project was developed as a semester project during my masters program. The Android app detects lanes on road, overlays using a red line and calculate estimated values of Standard Deviation of Lane Position (SDLP) based on position of car in the lain. The motivation of developing this android app as a proof of concept was to help researchers in domain of ergonomics to investigate driverâ€™s behavior in different scenarios.   

Source and details are available on [Github](https://github.com/wahibhaq/android-opencv-lanedetection).
