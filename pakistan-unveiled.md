This is where I would write about Pakistan, to clear misconceptions of outside world and would try to give a rational picture. Something more about how I feel the world should know my homeland and a nation of 200 million awesome human beings minus religious fanatics. 

Sophee Southall, An australian travel blogger, famously described her [experience](http://sopheesmiles.com/2015/08/22/pakistan-unveiled/) of visiting Pakistan in these words.

> Ultimately, while Pakistan offers enough experiences to entertain short-term tourists, this complex country isn't a holiday destination, it's a unique classroom offering a sharp, character-building education for adventurous nomads. A trip to Pakistan will not only change your perspective on Pakistani and Muslim culture, it'll also challenge how you view the rest of the world especially countries which cop a lot of flak in the media.



# Tourism : Visit Pakistan
---

### New Options for International Tourists

 - The guys from [The Broke Backpacker](http://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/) are planning a small operation with a focus on cultural experiences and real, off-the beaten path, adventures. They will take a group of International tourists to Pakistan in [September 2017](http://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/broke-backpacker-adventure-tours/). If you are interested than you should checkout the details of the trip in this [document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nh3ca2j4rvr94oq/Incredible%20Pakistan%202017.pdf?dl=0).
- Dawn has published a nice [article](https://www.dawn.com/news/1345531/travel-summers-here-five-treks-to-do-up-north) on the idea of **SUMMER’S HERE: FIVE TREKS TO DO UP NORTH**. Pakistan is a mountaineer’s paradise. This makes the possibility of the sheer variety of treks among these giants nearly endless. They’ve shortlisted five once-in-a-lifetime treks for you to take this summer, in order of difficulty. The main trekking and mountaineering season ends in September and so there is still time to head for an adventure in the north.

#### 2017

  - Australian Biker behind [AtTheHandleBars](http://atthehandlebars.com/about/) visited Pakistan in Feb 2017 and described it as a nature lovers hidden paradise, left mostly untouched by the rest of the world. Totally loved how he used the most common misconceptions as the headlines in his [blog post](http://atthehandlebars.com/pakistan/) and then brilliantly explained why they are all just plain wrong. He also posts regularly about his adventures on his [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/atthehandlebars/). Thanks mate for visiting, exploring and sharing your experiences from such a personal and human factor. 
  - Johanna Michel, french traveler visited Pakistan in Feb 2017. She summed up her experience in these words, "In my time spent in Pakistan, all I saw was amazing hospitality, landscape, food, music, and the most welcoming people. Everyone was kind and loving, and they would do everything to make you feel at home. I haven't come across such generosity anywhere else in the world (and I have travelled quite a bit)". She even wrote an [article in Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1324181/diary-of-a-french-girl-in-pakistan) and gave an [interview to Jovago](https://www.jovago.net/blog/foreigner-pakistan-french-girl-biggest-problem-5223) which is much appreciated.

#### 2016
  - [Sophee Southall (Australian)](http://sopheesmiles.com/about/sophees-story/) travelled to Lahore, Islamabad and Northern Pakistan and described her experience as "I carried a reinvigorated sense of hope and optimist with me. It’s the best souvenir I could’ve asked for. Thank you Pakistan".
