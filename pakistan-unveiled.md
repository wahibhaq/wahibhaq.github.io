This is where I would write about Pakistan, to clear misconceptions of outside world and would try to give a rational picture. Something more about how I feel the world should know my homeland and a nation of 200 million awesome human beings minus religious fanatics. 

Sophee Southall, An australian travel blogger, famously described her [experience](http://sopheesmiles.com/2015/08/22/pakistan-unveiled/) of visiting Pakistan in these words.

> Ultimately, while Pakistan offers enough experiences to entertain short-term tourists, this complex country isn't a holiday destination, it's a unique classroom offering a sharp, character-building education for adventurous nomads. A trip to Pakistan will not only change your perspective on Pakistani and Muslim culture, it'll also challenge how you view the rest of the world especially countries which cop a lot of flak in the media.
