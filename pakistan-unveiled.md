This is where I would write about Pakistan, to clear misconceptions of outside world and would try to give a rational picture. Something more about how I feel the world should know my homeland and a nation of 200 million awesome human beings minus religious fanatics. 

Sophee Southall, An australian travel blogger, famously described her [experience](http://sopheesmiles.com/2015/08/22/pakistan-unveiled/) of visiting Pakistan in these words.

> Ultimately, while Pakistan offers enough experiences to entertain short-term tourists, this complex country isn't a holiday destination, it's a unique classroom offering a sharp, character-building education for adventurous nomads. A trip to Pakistan will not only change your perspective on Pakistani and Muslim culture, it'll also challenge how you view the rest of the world especially countries which cop a lot of flak in the media.

It’s the best souvenir I could’ve asked for. Thank you Pakistan".

  - [Emily Hauze](https://twitter.com/EmilyHauze) is an American blogger & professional photographer. She frequently visits her loved ones in Pakistan but confidently says that there are many other reasons of attraction to the culture and curiosity about the Pakistani way of life. But for her, the question of a “reason to visit Pakistan” is almost irrelevant, because the truth is that Pakistan has given her a reason to do almost everything that she does. Recently her [interview](https://www.jovago.net/blog/emily-hauze-american-loves-pakistan-3188) with [Jovago](https://twitter.com/JovagoPakistan) got published and that's how I came to know about her.

Seven months afterwards I indeed have cried two times.
