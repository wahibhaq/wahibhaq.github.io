This lightning talk was given at [DACHFest Munich](https://dachfest.com/) to highlight some misconceptions, why it matters to practice empathy towards users, adjusting expectations, working with designers and some tips from personal experiences. It was my first talk at DACHFest and my first non-technical talk as well. I am glad I applied for it because the response was pretty amazing and well received.
