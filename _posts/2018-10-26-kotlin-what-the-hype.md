This talk was given as part of our regular bi-weekly **[KI University](https://ki-labs.github.io/ki-university/)** session which is an internal company event at [KI labs](https://ki-labs.com). 

I shared my enthusiasm for "Kotlin" with company colleagues and It was meant to help other engineers getting familiar with the idea of **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)** and motivate them to see its potential which goes beyond Android. I would love to see backend & data engineers consider this modern programming language for their next projects.

Feel free to use the slides to share with your friends and colleagues in company :)

P.S At KI labs, we only use Kotlin in our Android projects ✌️
