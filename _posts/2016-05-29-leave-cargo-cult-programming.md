# How to step forward from Cargo Cult Programming phase

- Read official documentation first
- If copy stackoverflow code, then what to do?
	- read about new function, strategy, technique so you know why you are using and what are the repurcussions
	
- If you are trying to learn a new language,
	- create a github repo and start documenting articles you read and code you try out. it helps in better memorizing and also gives confidence
	- talk about it so that others can ask questions
	
- best way is to teach someone or participate in a discussion. it forces you to question your understanding, rectify your false learnings and learn from others
- better write a post about your new learning. it forces you to better research as you don't want to share misinformation or half-cooked knowledge. give e.g of post about android interview questions
