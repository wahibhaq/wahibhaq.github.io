This talk was given at [KTUG Munich Jan Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-User-Group-Munich/events/257927489/) and later at [GDG Android Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Munich-Android/).

Primary motivation was to share our learnings with the community while using Kotlin Coroutines for an interesting use case we had in our project. We are barely scratching the surface but I felt it might help others in making some better decisions with parent-child setup if they know the different uses of certain CoroutineScopes.
