# Android Tech Stack at Freeletics


Android developers often ask me about which 3rd party libraries are used in [Bodyweight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freeletics.lite) and [Nutrition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freeletics.nutrition) android apps from [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/de/). So, to answer all those questions, I wrote a blog post talking about just that and it is live and running on [Engineering Blog](http://freeletics.engineering/).
