	* avoid making useless comments
		* I have learnt that it's better not to comment on something which can make someone uncomfortable or insecure, specially never in public
		* from things ranging from appearance to dressing
	* Don't have pre-defined conclusions before discussing a controversial topic
		* I	have discussed diverse topics ranging from war, terrorism, history to religion with german colleagues and noticed something very remarkable. When they put questions, they don't have any preconceived conclusions in their mind even if they are well-versed with that topic. They would give you the chance to speak and express your perspective specially if it directly related to your country of origin or religion.
