We wanted to understand when the user enters or leaves concerned locations or Point of Interests (POI). It is easier said than done and we explored several solutions. 
Listening and keeping track of a Wi-Fi connection or disconnection status was one of the ways we wanted to try and test. As soon as we started implementing, 
it became more evident that things have quite changed since Android 7.0 (aka Nougat).

We went through quite a struggle to sort things out for ourselves and sharing our learnings and experiences here so that maybe it can save some time for you.
