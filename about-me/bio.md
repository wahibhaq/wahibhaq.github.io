My name is Wahib, I'm a programmer by choice, product development enthusiast and someone who takes keen interest in more than just the coding side of a mobile app. I am currently working as an <strong>Senior Android Developer</strong> at <a href="https://payback.net" target="_blank">PAYBACK</a> where I turn elixirs of code into always-happy users of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.payback.client.android&hl=en" target="_blank">PAYBACK app</a>. Prior to this, I have worked atÂ <a href="https://ki-labs.com" target="_blank">KI labs</a>, <a href="https://freeletics.com" target="_blank">Freeletics(~20M users)</a>, <a href="https://www.thinxnet.com/" target="_blank">ThinxNet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/apple-metaio/" target="_blank">Metaio (acquired by Apple Inc.)</a> and <a href="https://www.dplit.com/" target="_blank">DPLIT</a>. I first found my passion for <a href="https://developer.android.com/index.html" target="_blank">Android</a> whilst I was at university and have been working with it non-stop since â€“ I find it an amazing platform. I have worked in early age startups, mid-size services company and high-growth product companies which has helped me grow in leadership, teamwork, and knowledge.

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I completed <strong>BSc. Information and Communication Systems Engingeering</strong> from <a href="http://seecs.nust.edu.pk" target="_blank">NUST</a>, Pakistan in 2011. Then I landed in <strong>Munich, Germany</strong> in 2013 to pursue <strong>MSc. Computer Science</strong> from <a href="http://www.in.tum.de/en.html" target="_blank">Technical University of Munich</a> and since then, I fell in love with this city.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-paper-plane about-icon"></span>
I am quite passionate about engineering culture, better processes and building the "right" product for the end users. The "Product, Engineering and People" domain is something I am investing my energy in and trying to learn and grow myself. I'm an avid reader, easy-to-go guy, a foodie (I come from the lands of exotic food!). In my free time, I love travelling, reading books, hanging out with friends or watching a good movie at home. All hobby projects or the proverbial itch that needs scratching would go in <a href="http://wahibhaq.com/projects">projects</a> section.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-paper-plane about-icon"></span>
I strongly believe in giving back to the community and always looking for opportunities to learn and share knowledge with others. I write blogs, <a href="http://wahibhaq.com/community-work/presentations-and-talks/">speak at events</a> and co-organize <a href="http://wahibhaq.com/community-work/developer-relations-meetup/">@DevRelMunich community</a> events in Munich. I have been running <a href="http://wahibhaq.com/community-work/android-devchat-slack/">"AndroidDevChat" Slack community</a> for Pakistani Android Devs for more than 2 years now. This year, I have also been part of <a href="https://www.bshaccelerator.com/">BSH Smart Home Accelerator program</a> as a <a href="https://www.techstars.com/mentors/wahib-ul-haq/">"Startup Mentor"</a>.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-heartbeat about-icon"></span>
I was born and bred in <strong>Rawalpindi, Pakistan</strong> and quite an Urdu language enthusiast. I invested some time and energy last year to work on a side project to create awareness about using "Nastaliq" for Urdu on digital space. I ended up publishing an Android app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidistan.urdufontcomparator" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and also wrote <a href="http://wahibhaq.com/blog/introducing-urdu-font-comparator-app/" target="_blank">post</a> about the project.

If you are curious to know more about multifaceted Pakistan <img src="/img/pakistan-flag.png" width="25" height="25"> or maybe ever thought about visiting, then do checkout <a href="http://wahibhaq.com/community-work/pakistan-tourism/">Visit Pakistan</a>. It is a personal effort to compile updates about International tourists who've visited Pakistan in past and also help you in finding all the good reasons to visit as well :)

Itâ€™s another place I love to connect with like minded people, so feel free to ping me at <strong>wahib.tech@gmail.com</strong>, connect via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahibhaq">Linkedin</a> or follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/wahibhaq">Twitter</a> / <a href="http://instagram.com/not_that_pindi_boy">Instagram</a>. I normally tweet about Android, Expat, All things Pakistani & Life's lemons. I am a kind of lazy storyteller who likes to share about what's going around him. I write what I like, but sometimes not, and any opinions I express are usually my own.

    I spend a lot of time on my packages and I make sure they're high quality.
    <br/>
    I try to always respond to questions or bug reports about my packages immediately.
    <br/>
    I spent a considerable amount of time developing the Beautiful Jekyll theme and I've gone through dozens of iterations on the instructions in order to ensure they are as simple as possible.
    <br/>
    Each of my technical blog posts takes many hours because I really try to make everything as clear and useful as possible.
    <br/>
    I also get emails daily asking for some advice or help (mostly with R or Shiny), and I make an honest attempt at responding to everyone.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Since I <i>am</i> devoting so much of myself to all this, it would be amazing if some of my hard work translated into some compensation so that Iâ€”a student in the most expensive city in Canadaâ€”will be able to shop at fancy Whole Foods once in a while :)

    If you do click the Donate button, I thank you immensely!
