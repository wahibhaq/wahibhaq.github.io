title: Developer Relations Munich Community
---

I am very excited to share that I have co-launched [Developer Relations Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dev-Rel-Munich/) with [Denis](https://twitter.com/deniswsrosa) in May, 2019. 

### Background

After experience of 1 year of working as part-time "Developer Advocate" at KI labs, I got really curious to explore career choices. I wasn't hired for this but instead created a position for myself because I like doing community work, company branding and leading initiatives which can nurture engineering culture. 

I remember, I searched for "Developer Advocates in Munich" on LinkedIn and found Denis who is Developer Advocate at Couchbase. He was kind enough to answer a long list of questions and during our conversation we realized that there is no such community here in Munich related to this domani of Developer Advocate/Relations/Evangelism. I don't think it took long for us to commit to this idea and we had a meetup page in few weeks. 

This is kind of topics we want to cover through our meetups:

### Kick-off

We already organized our [first meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/Dev-Rel-Munich/events/261446965/) which was uber successful with 60+ attendees, two very interesting talks and a [surprise music performance](https://twitter.com/DevRelMunich/status/1138512914170728448) :)

Back in 2017, I felt a strong need to connect with fellow Android Devs in <img src="/img/pakistan-flag.png" width="25" height="25"> Pakistan but couldn't find any appropriate online space. After talking to fellow devs and graduating students, many of us realized that there's a significant gap when it comes to care for "doing things the right way" and being aware of latest approaches and tools.
