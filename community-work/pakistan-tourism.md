This is where I would write about Traveling to Pakistan, to clear misconceptions of outside world and would try to give a rational picture. Something more about how I feel the world should know my homeland and a nation of 200 million awesome human beings minus religious fanatics. 

Sophee Southall, An australian travel blogger, famously described her [experience](http://sopheesmiles.com/2015/08/22/pakistan-unveiled/) of visiting Pakistan in these words.

> Ultimately, while Pakistan offers enough experiences to entertain short-term tourists, this complex country isn't a holiday destination, it's a unique classroom offering a sharp, character-building education for adventurous nomads. A trip to Pakistan will not only change your perspective on Pakistani and Muslim culture, it'll also challenge how you view the rest of the world especially countries which cop a lot of flak in the media.


### New Options for International Tourists

 - The guys from [The Broke Backpacker](http://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/) are planning a small operation with a focus on cultural experiences and real, off-the beaten path, adventures. They will take a group of International tourists to Pakistan in [September 2017](http://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/broke-backpacker-adventure-tours/). If you are interested than you should checkout the details of the trip in this [document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nh3ca2j4rvr94oq/Incredible%20Pakistan%202017.pdf?dl=0).
 
- Dawn has published a nice [article](https://www.dawn.com/news/1345531/travel-summers-here-five-treks-to-do-up-north) on the idea of **SUMMER’S HERE: FIVE TREKS TO DO UP NORTH**. Pakistan is a mountaineer’s paradise. This makes the possibility of the sheer variety of treks among these giants nearly endless. They’ve shortlisted five once-in-a-lifetime treks for you to take this summer, in order of difficulty. The main trekking and mountaineering season ends in September and so there is still time to head for an adventure in the north.

### International Tourists who visited Pakistan

Their documentary will be [screened](https://www.picture-organic-clothing.com/en/poster/zabardast/) in December 2018 but [trailor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBvsaIBsVJY) is already available.
  - Foreign tourists have been coming very regularly but very few got a chance to get viral and a well known face among Pakistanis. [Eva Zu Beck](https://www.youtube.com/c/evazubeck) is one of those faces for all the good reasons. She has been activily traveling around Pakistan and recording her [vlogs](https://www.facebook.com/K2BaseCampTrekking/videos/1664209273668789/). She is also very active on her [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/evazubeck) and you should follow her for good dose of traveling updates. She has tens of videos on Pakistan but I would like to give special mention to [Why I love Pakistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPs0XrtQoGA) and [Everything you need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dFi2VAUEiI) videos because they offer some authentic knowledge to outside world.
   
  - World should remember a new name, Andrzej Bargiel because this guy did one hell of a crazy thing by putting down the first-ever ski descent of the Karakorum giant known as K2 in July 2018. You can read more about it [here](https://www.redbull.com/ca-en/andrzej-bargiel-summit-k2) and this is a short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZRqeRRik8c).

I would like to give her special thanks for writing on [10 experiences that need to be on your Pakistan bucket list](https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/pakistan-bucket-list/) which is an ultimate list not even many Pakistanis have checked off from their list :) 

#### 2017

  - Polish couple (Kate and Lukasz) who also run the facebook group [By The Way](https://www.facebook.com/bythewapl/) were in Pakistan in December 2017 and fell in love with what they saw and experienced.

  - [Afiniti's](https://www.afiniti.com/) International Team of more than 12 visited Pakistan and enjoyed an insane heli-skiing experience this year in September in the northern snow-capped peaks of Pakistan.

  - Australian Biker behind [AtTheHandleBars](http://atthehandlebars.com/about/) visited Pakistan in Feb 2017 and described it as a nature lovers hidden paradise, left mostly untouched by the rest of the world.

He also posts regularly about his adventures on his [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/atthehandlebars/). Thanks mate for visiting, exploring and sharing your experiences from such a personal and human factor. 
  - Johanna Michel, french traveler visited Pakistan in Feb 2017. She summed up her experience in these words, "In my time spent in Pakistan, all I saw was amazing hospitality, landscape, food, music, and the most welcoming people. Everyone was kind and loving, and they would do everything to make you feel at home. I haven't come across such generosity anywhere else in the world (and I have travelled quite a bit)". She even wrote an [article in Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1324181/diary-of-a-french-girl-in-pakistan) and gave an [interview to Jovago](https://www.jovago.net/blog/foreigner-pakistan-french-girl-biggest-problem-5223) which is much appreciated.

#### 2016

  - [Emily Hauze](https://twitter.com/EmilyHauze) is an American blogger & professional photographer. She frequently visits her loved ones in Pakistan but confidently says that there are many other reasons of attraction to the culture and curiosity about the Pakistani way of life. But for her, the question of a “reason to visit Pakistan” is almost irrelevant, because the truth is that Pakistan has given her a reason to do almost everything that she does. Recently her [interview](https://www.jovago.net/blog/emily-hauze-american-loves-pakistan-3188) with [Jovago](https://twitter.com/JovagoPakistan) got published and that's how I came to know about her.
