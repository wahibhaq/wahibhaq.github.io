### Keynote talk: What all these years of Android Development have taught me the hard way

*Date: 31.03.2018, Event: [AndroidDevFest](https://www.facebook.com/events/2028371470710712/), Location: Islamabad, Pakistan*

This is just my humble effort to share insights and learnings from my career and things I wish I would have known back in the day. There will be advice, rant, anecdotes, things which worked for me and how devs can step up their game.
